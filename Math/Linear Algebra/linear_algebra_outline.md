# What is this directory about?
---

In the Math folder, I'll make several different sub-folders for different branches of math that'll be required. Hopefully many people will find it useful.

More specifically, the **linear algebra** directory will contain notes about linear algebra.
The basic outline will follow the structure of the well-known classic *An Introduction to Linear Algebra (4e) - Gilbert Strang*.
There will be supplementary information contained in these notes as well.

If there are any errors or you have any suggestions, please feel free to let me know!

Happy learning!
