## 1.1 Vectors and Linear Combinations

### Vector Addition

Vector addition is simple. Just think of it as adding the same coordinates with each other. For example let's say we have two vectors,

$$\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
1\\\\
2\\\\
\end{bmatrix}$$
and
$$\vec{w} = \begin{bmatrix}
3\\\\
4\\\\
\end{bmatrix}$$

The result of adding these two vectors would be

$$\vec{v} + \vec{w} = \begin{bmatrix}
1+3\\\\
2+4\\\\
\end{bmatrix}$$


At the start of the chapter, Professor Strang states that "You can't add apples and oranges." This makes sense because we can only add objects that are the same.

â€» Note: The algebraic commutative property of $a + b = b + a$ also applies to vectors.


### Scalar Multiplication

Scalar multiplication is also simple. You're just multiplying ("broadcasting") the scalar to each component of the vector. If we take the vector $\vec{v}$ from earlier,

$$
\begin{align}
\vec{v} & = 2\ \times\ \begin{bmatrix}
1\\\\
2\\\\
\end(bmatrix)
& = \begin{bmatrix}
2\\\\
4\\\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
