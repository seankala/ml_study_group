# Chapter 1: Introduction to Vectors

_The first chapter attempts to give the reader a basic understanding of the basic units of operation/computation for linear algebra: vectors and matrices._

* 1.1 - Vectors and Linear Combinations
* 1.2 - Lengths and Dot Products
* 1.3 - Matrices

### Vector Addition

Vector addition is simple. Just think of it as adding the same coordinates with each other. For example let's say we have two vectors,

$$\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &\\\\
2 &\\\\
\end{bmatrix}$$ and $$\vec{w} = \begin{bmatrix}3 &\\\\ 4 &\\\\\end{bmatrix}$$
