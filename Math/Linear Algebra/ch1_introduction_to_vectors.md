### Vector Addition

Vector addition is simple. Just think of it as adding the same coordinates with each other. For example let's say we have two vectors,

$$\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
1\\\\
2\\\\
\end{bmatrix}$$
and
$$\vec{w} = \begin{bmatrix}
3\\\\
4\\\\
\end{bmatrix}$$

The result of adding these two vectors would be

$$\vec{v} + \vec{w} = \begin{bmatrix}
1+3\\\\
2+4\\\\
\end{bmatrix}$$


At the start of the chapter, Professor Strang states that "You can't add apples and oranges." This makes sense because we can only add objects that are the same.

โป Note: The algebraic commutative property of $a + b = b + a$ also applies to vectors.


### Scalar Multiplication

Scalar multiplication is also simple. You're just multiplying ("broadcasting") the scalar to each component of the vector. If we take the vector $\vec{v}$ from earlier,

$$
\begin{align}
\vec{v} & = 2 \times \begin{bmatrix}
1\\\\
2\\\\
\end{bmatrix} \\\\
& = 
\begin{bmatrix}
2\\\\
4\\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$


### Linear Combinations

By definition, a _**linear combination**_ is combining addition and scalar multiplication.

In simpler terms, the sum of the vectors multiplied by any scalar(s) is called a linear combination. $c\vec{v} + d\vec{w}$ is a linear combination of the vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$.

_**ยง The three notions of vector addition, scalar multiplication, and linear combinations are central to linear algebra. We'll get into more detail later and why they're so important.**_


### Vectors in Three Dimensions

Vectors in three dimensions are analogous to vectors in two dimensions. The only difference is that they have an extra component to account for the third dimension.


### The Important Questions

This section addresses some important geometric aspects of linear algebras.

1. What is the picture of _all_ combinations on $c\vec{u}$?
2. What is the picture of _all_ combinations $c\vec{u} + d\vec{v}$?
3. What is the picture of _all_ combinations $c\vec{u} + d\vec{v} + e\vec{w}$?

The answers to these questions is relatively simple and even intuitive if you put your focus on the fact that a vector is essentially _pointing to a certain point_.

This means that if we have a vector $\vec{u}$ that is pointing to a certain point in space, then the linear combinations of all of the different points that make up $c\vec{u}$ will essentially be a line. For example, let's say that the vector $\vec{u}$ is as follows:

$$\vec{u} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\\\
2\\\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Now, let's say that the values for the scalar $c$ in $c\vec{u}$ are $0$,$\ 0.5$,$\ 1$,$\ 1.5$,$\ 2$, and$\ 2.5$. In other words, $c = \\{0,\  0.5,\ 1,\ 1.5,\ 2,\ 2.5 \\}$.

The linear combinations, then, of $c\vec{u}$ would be:

$$c\vec{u} =
\begin{Bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  0\\\\
  0\\\\
\end{bmatrix},\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
  0.5\\\\
  1\\\\
\end{bmatrix},\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1\\\\
  2\\\\
\end{bmatrix},\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1.5\\\\
  3\\\\
\end{bmatrix},\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
  2\\\\
  4\\\\
\end{bmatrix},\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
  2.5\\\\
  5\\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{Bmatrix}
$$

Let's write some code to visualize these results. As stated earlier, it's convenient if we think of vectors as essentially _**arrows that point to a specific point in space**_. The $x$-values would be the first components of each vector, and the $y$-values are the second. The code to visualize this is as follows:

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np


x = np.arange(0, 3, 0.5)
y = np.array([(num * 2) for num in x])
zeros = (np.zeros(x.shape[0]), np.zeros(x.shape[0]))
colors = ['r', 'b', 'g', 'c', 'm', 'y']

plt.quiver(*zeros, x, y, color=colors, angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1)
plt.xlim(-6, 6)
plt.ylim(-6, 6)
plt.grid()

plt.show()
```

This code produces the following image:

![Vector $\vec{u}$ linear combinations](https://github.com/seankala/ml_study_group/blob/master/Images/vector_plots.png?raw=true)

It's not difficult to see that if we were to take every single real value of $c$ and multiplied it to the vector $\vec{u}$, we would eventually get a straight line.

The plots for the second and third questions are a bit harder to visualize (I'm actually not sure if it's possible to simply visualize it without actual animations), so I'll leave it out but if you feel the need for visual stimulus then I highly recommend watching the 3Blue1Brown videos posted at the start.

### Problem Set 1.1

1. Describe geometrically (line, plane, or all of $\Bbb{R^3$}) all linear combinations of:
  * (a) $\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\\\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix}3\\\\6\\\\9\\\\end{bmatrix}$
