### Vector Addition

Vector addition is simple. Just think of it as adding the same coordinates with each other. For example let's say we have two vectors,

$$\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
1\\\\
2\\\\
\end{bmatrix}$$
and
$$\vec{w} = \begin{bmatrix}
3\\\\
4\\\\
\end{bmatrix}$$

The result of adding these two vectors would be

$$\vec{v} + \vec{w} = \begin{bmatrix}
1+3\\\\
2+4\\\\
\end{bmatrix}$$


At the start of the chapter, Professor Strang states that "You can't add apples and oranges." This makes sense because we can only add objects that are the same.

โป Note: The algebraic commutative property of $a + b = b + a$ also applies to vectors.


### Scalar Multiplication

Scalar multiplication is also simple. You're just multiplying ("broadcasting") the scalar to each component of the vector. If we take the vector $\vec{v}$ from earlier,

$$
\begin{align}
\vec{v} & = 2 \times \begin{bmatrix}
1\\\\
2\\\\
\end{bmatrix} \\\\
& = 
\begin{bmatrix}
2\\\\
4\\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$


### Linear Combinations

By definition, a _**linear combination**_ is combining addition and scalar multiplication.

In simpler terms, the sum of the vectors multiplied by any scalar(s) is called a linear combination. $c\vec{v} + d\vec{w}$ is a linear combination of the vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$.

_**ยง The three notions of vector addition, scalar multiplication, and linear combinations are central to linear algebra. We'll get into more detail later and why they're so important.**_


### Vectors in Three Dimensions

Vectors in three dimensions are analogous to vectors in two dimensions. The only difference is that they have an extra component to account for the third dimension.


### The Important Questions

This section addresses some important geometric aspects of linear algebras.

1. What is the picture of _all_ combinations on $c\vec{u}$?
2. What is the picture of _all_ combinations $c\vec{u} + d\vec{v}$?
3. What is the picture of _all_ combinations $c\vec{u} + d\vec{v} + e\vec{w}$?

The answers to these questions is relatively simple and even intuitive if you put your focus on the fact that a vector is essentially _pointing to a certain point_.

This means that if we have a vector $\vec{u}$ that is pointing to a certain point in space, then the linear combinations of all of the different points that make up $c\vec{u}$ will essentially be a line. For example, let's say that the vector $\vec{u}$ is as follows:

$$\vec{u} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\\\
2\\\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Now, let's say that the values for the scalar $c$ in $c\vec{u}$ are $0$,$\ 0.5$,$\ 1$,$\ 1.5$,$\ 2$, and$\ 2.5$. In other words, $c = \\{0,\  0.5,\ 1,\ 1.5,\ 2,\ 2.5 \\}$.

The linear combinations, then, of $c\vec{u}$ would be:

$$c\vec{u} =
\begin{Bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  0\\\\
  0\\\\
\end{bmatrix},\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
  0.5\\\\
  1\\\\
\end{bmatrix},\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1\\\\
  2\\\\
\end{bmatrix},\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1.5\\\\
  3\\\\
\end{bmatrix},\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
  2\\\\
  4\\\\
\end{bmatrix},\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
  2.5\\\\
  5\\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{Bmatrix}
$$
