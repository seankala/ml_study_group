    "# Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\n",
    "\n",
    "As the title implies, this chapter walks us through a machine learning project from the start to finish. It's very nice in the sense that we get a feel of what a machine learning project in the real life (at least from the author's perspective) may look like, what we need to think about, and what steps we need to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be covering each section of the chapter briefly. It's rather long but shouldn't be too much if we keep it short and cover the main points.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll keep an appendix of all of the mentioned Python commands/methods used with a link to the corresponding documentation."
