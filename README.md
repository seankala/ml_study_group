# ML Study Group

---

This repository will contain the information and material that we cover at the ML Study Group.

The ML Study Group is - as the name implies - a Meetup group where people who are interested in studying the various aspects of machine leanring (code, math, theory, applications, etc.) come together to help each other.

We usually follow but are not limited to a set curriculum.
